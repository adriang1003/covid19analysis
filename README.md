# COVID-19: Data Analysis
Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen many variations of state government mandates issued to mitigate the spread of the disease as well as different states having varying levels of stringency of such mandates throughout the pandemic. Thus, the goal of this project is to research to what extent did mandates, and how stringent these varied, affect how fast the disease spread across the US. To do this, we will be using the "United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time" data set from the CDC ("https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36"); in which, contains 15 characteristics and 60,000 samples listed below. In using this data set, we will be testing 4 hypotheses. (1) Larger populated states saw more total cases and deaths than smaller states, regardless of mandate strictness. (2/3) Lax COVID-19-restricted states had a greater number of new/total cases per 100,000 than stricter states. (4) The top five largest states accounted for half of the new cases in the US.
